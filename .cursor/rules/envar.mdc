- All environment variables must start with ANP_
- All environment variables must be loaded through the Specification feature. Do not access environment variables directly; use the Specification struct and its GetConfig method.
- Upper case acronyms are not allowed in Specification naming. For example, ANP_RSS_URL translates to RssUrl, not RSSURL.
- All Specificiations must have a Validate() rule
