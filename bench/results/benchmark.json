Recently, I participated in Unicorn Factory Lisboa‚Äôs Winter Batch and won first place, presenting my application to a jury of 15 VCs. Once I launch it, you‚Äôll see how powerful managing, reusing, and collaborating on prompts in real-time can be. Right now, I‚Äôm inviting people to join my closed beta. And yes my app will be available for free üëÄ \nComment: Thanks to Cursor I built netbeep.com - a single pane of glass approach to domain information.  Netbeep spawned because I just wanted all the info upfront. And I got tired of the crappy UX from all the other sites that do this with their goofy UI friction points. As an ecom marketing wonk working with lots of clients I get engaged with their DNS often which is usually malformed in most cases. And because, I, like you, have a bunch of personal domains I own spread across various registrars, it makes it easier to get a quick glance at their config. The site is ever evolving thanks to user feedbac...\nComment: I built RenoMate.io- an AI-powered home renovation platform.  The idea for RenoMate was inspired by my own renovation. I felt like there wasn‚Äôt a great tool for the more tactical elements of managing a home renovation. Especially around selection and management of the required materials.  I experimented with many tools on my journey to being a solo developer, but discovering Cursor was a game changer in terms of speed and flexibility. Many have shared similar, but I want to reiterate the ‚ÄúCursor Pro Tip‚Äù of using a spec/roadmap. Use Cursor to write it, audit it, iterate on it, implement ...\nComment: Built a fully working social media for recipe sharing. Also added AI recipe generation. Would love some feedback! Cursor helped me with the UI mainly.  https://savorycircle.com \n",
        "Title: Rules in 49.6: Major Issues Uncovered\nID: t3_1kbt790\nSummary: Title: Investigating Cursor Rules in 49.6: Major Issues Uncovered Cursor rules in 49.6 are behaving inconsistently for me, so I conducted deep testing to understand their functionality. I discovered reproducible issues that severely impact context management, making rules unreliable for workflows like task creation. Major Discoveries: 1. Auto Attached Rules Don‚Äôt Load: Rules for specific file types (e.g., *.py or *.txt) often fail to apply when you open, edit, or reference files (e.g., @file.py). For example, a rule to add comments (e.g., # Rule Applied) to Python files rarely works, even with correct setup in .cursor/rules. This bug (Bug 1) means your custom formatting or context instructions are frequently ignored, disrupting file-specific workflows. 2. Always Rules Are Unstable: Rules set to apply universally (e.g., adding a header like # Always Rule to all responses) work briefly but drop off in longer sessions. In a 20-prompt test, the header was missing in 18 responses, often failing after the first or second prompt. This bug (Bug 2) makes consistent context unreliable, as rules vanish unpredictably during extended use. Actions Taken: I‚Äôve filed two bug reports in the Bug...\nComment: Title: Investigating Cursor Rules in 49.6: Major Issues Uncovered Cursor rules in 49.6 are behaving inconsistently for me, so I conducted deep testing to understand their functionality.

Ideal user. \nComment: Do you work as QA in a software company by any chance? \nComment: Is it possible that \"Always\" rules that show as present first get aged out of the context as discussion goes on? Wouldn't be so much a cursor bug as a model limitation \nComment: Doing gods work \nComment: Was this functionality working previously? \nComment: Just today I couldn‚Äôt get rules to function, figured it was just me being inexperienced and setting up something wrong. Gemini, sonnet 3.4 and 3.7 \nComment: Anyone that has used \"rules\" know that the AI doesn't seem to follow them. At least not all of them, it's pretty obvious. Great post! \nComment: https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/s/3mQgtH78oY Yeah, I noticed some of this a month ago, and was one of the reasons I decided to leave cursor. Good report \nComment: Cursor is a piece of shit company if they don‚Äôt give you some credits as goodwill for this \n",

            "ID": "t3_1kc0379",
            "Summary": "This post is an offer from a former Facebook engineer to help developers struggling with complex application issues, particularly around authentication and payment systems. The offer includes a free 15-minute screen share to diagnose the problem, with potential for a quick fix or a quoted hourly/flat rate for larger tasks. The engineer emphasizes transparency in pricing and avoids agency overhead. While not directly about Cursor IDE, it highlights a common pain point for developers using the tool ‚Äì scaling projects beyond simple examples. The post is aimed at providing practical assistance to those facing real-world development challenges.",
            "CommentSummary": "The community response is generally positive, with several users expressing interest in the offer and asking about pricing. One user specifically mentions difficulties with the Facebook Ads API, which could be relevant for developers integrating social media features into their Cursor IDE projects. The overall sentiment suggests a need for experienced assistance in tackling complex application development tasks.",

            "Summary": "A user reports experiencing high memory usage in Cursor IDE, specifically with a Nest.js repository on an M1 Mac (16GB RAM). The issue seems intermittent, occurring after leaving Cursor open for a day or so. They note the app is relatively small, suggesting the memory consumption isn't directly tied to project size. The user doesn‚Äôt provide specific metrics, but describes the IDE 'eating' RAM over time.",
            "CommentSummary": "The community response is limited, with one user asking if the reporter is working on any machine learning projects. This suggests a potential link between ML workloads and memory usage, but it's purely speculative at this point. There‚Äôs no further discussion about debugging strategies or potential solutions.",

            "Summary": "A user is experiencing issues with the o4-mini and o3 models in Cursor IDE, reporting excessive 'grepping' of the codebase without generating responses. The issue manifests as a continuous scrollbar filling with 'Grepped codebase for...' and 'Read file...' messages, even after prompting the model to stop. The user is seeking advice on how to get these models functioning correctly, as they are currently unusable. Other commenters confirm similar behavior, suggesting a recent regression in performance.",
            "CommentSummary": "The community sentiment is overwhelmingly negative regarding the current state of o4-mini and o3 models. Users report that these models are stuck in a loop of excessive codebase reading without producing meaningful output, effectively rendering them unusable. Several commenters suggest that these models function correctly only within the OAIs Codex CLI, implying a potential issue with Cursor IDE's integration or configuration. There is concern about the models draining wallet resources due to continuous tool calls.",

            "Summary": "This post details a thorough investigation into inconsistencies with Cursor's rules feature in version 49.6, specifically focusing on 'Auto Attached Rules' and 'Always Rules'. The author found that Auto Attached Rules frequently fail to apply when opening or referencing files, even with correct configuration.  'Always Rules', intended for universal application, often drop off after only a few prompts in a session ‚Äì failing in 90% of cases during testing. The author has filed bug reports and provides a clear description of the issues, highlighting disruptions to file-specific workflows and unreliable context management. The post sparked a lot of discussion about the reliability of rules in general.",
            "CommentSummary": "The community overwhelmingly agrees with the author's findings, reporting similar issues with Cursor rules. Many users express frustration that rules are not consistently applied and question the feature's overall reliability. Several commenters suggest the issue might be related to context window limitations, where older rules are 'aged out' as the conversation progresses. There is a general sentiment that Cursor should address these issues and potentially offer credits to users experiencing problems. The post is widely praised for its detailed testing and clear reporting.",
