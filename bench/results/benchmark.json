Thanks for sharing here. \nComment: What is the best use case for this model ? \nComment: BTW, 3.2 was pretty neat and nice. Going to test 3.3. Thanks for open-weighting them. \nComment: Granite-3.3 scores lower than Granite-3.1 ? How comes? https://preview.redd.it/kme7581bv7ve1.png?width=924\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=c1cfb3ceadaac8d09b6f96e7d24a53e64e4847df \nComment: Looks like everyone apart from \"Open\"AI is releasing open source models. \nComment: \"can be integrated into AI assistants across various domains\" 8b? \nComment: The two pass approach for the speech model seems interesting. The trade off seems to be keeping the 8b llm free from degradation by not making it truly multimodal in it's entirety. But, does that overall have benefit compared to using a discrete speech model and another llm? How many parameters does the speech model component use and are there speed benefits compared to a one pass multimodal model? \nComment: I tested it (f16), and it actually scored a bit worse than the Granite 3.0 Q8 I tested 6 months ago. Not the absolute worst, but just utterly uninteresting and beaten by a plethora of other models in the same size segment in pretty much all tested fields. \nComment: Dafuq?! Ok ibm, I see you interacting here and I didn‚Äôt expect that. I‚Äôm mainly interested in aider success % vs cost benchmarks these days because I‚Äôm a moron. Any of those out yet? \nComment: i would be very interested in a history lesson from the granite team concerning long past IBM Watson to present day LLMs from IBM perspective Watson was ahead of it's time. would love a blog post. \nComment: Didn't care much at first, but being that (it seems like) IBM decided to have someone participating here by answering questions and providing more information... I will give it a try. Nice move IBM! \nComment: These models are really really good I'm working with the 8b variant. They're very straight and to the point with their outputs. Which works well in an agentic system with lots of structured output and tool calling. Function / Tool calling works really well. I've compared them to Gemma 3 12b and Mistral Small 24b, Qwen 2.5 14b The output from them are quite amazing in my benchmark. It definitely beats Qwen 2.5 14b and is comparable to Gemma 3 12b and Mistral Small 24b. This model definitely punches above it's weight when it comes to agentic systems. At least for my use case. \nComment: when guff \nComment: Wow! Pleased to see IBM engaging with the community. \nComment: Will there be INT8/QAT variants on Hugging Face? Smaller deployment footprints would be huge for local apps. \nComment: This is cool. \nComment: Thank you for your effort, from the bottom of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è But it's just another completely expendable model, just like the other versions of Granite. The feeling it gives is that we are using a Llama who learned to say that he was created by IBM. \nComment: I wonder how Granite Speech 3.3 8B will compare against whisper \nComment: IBM: fix this grammar ;) Emotion detection: Future Granite Speech models will -be- support speech emotion recognition (SER) capabilities through training our acoustic encoder to be more sensitive to non-lexical audio events. \nComment: Excited to try Filling in the middle, but I wonder how easy it will be to do in some platforms. \nComment: is there going to be QAT versions available like gemma3 ? \nComment: I freaking loved Granite 3.2 \nComment: About how much VRAM to use this at full context when factoring in Q8? \nComment: Is there Turkish language support? \nComment: Are these somewhat optimized for power systems? Do you have any guides for running inference on power 8 if so? \nComment: Multilingual when? \nComment: I wonder how this compares to Cogito v1 preview - 8B? If the metrics are anything to go off of, granite seems better at math but worse at everything else? \nComment: It is not bad for its size. Good instruction following. Sadly, it hallucinates. But that's due to its size. I wonder how a decent sized version would perfom. ü§ì \nComment: How to enable thinking capability for granite 3.3 on lm studio ? \nComment: Will the Granite 3.3 Base Model be used to create a MoE reasoning model? \nComment: It's a huge shame that the speech model only supports English. \nComment: lol IBM \n","Title: Somebody needs to tell Nvidia to calm down with these new model names.\nID: t3_1k0u8ew\nSummary:         submitted by    /u/Porespellar   [link]   [comments] \nComment:         submitted by    /u/Porespellar   [link]   [comments] \nComment: you want them to call it the ultra long 8=D? \nComment: Why are they named like condoms? \nComment: Would you prefer NVidia Magnum 8b? \nComment: Now imagine Jensen Huang in his classic presentation of new GPU models, wearing his leather jacket, except this time he'd be holding that new ultra long model of theirs... \nComment: Ribbed for your pleasure \nComment: Nvidia Trojan Ultra Long 8B Pleasure Quantization Variety Pack \nComment: Unfortunately my GPU is allergic to contexticide and I'll have to make do with my 4k context window.  \nComment: It sounds like marketing for a condom company. \nComment: It says UltraLong on the packaging, and they even offer it in 3 sizes. Yet all of them get rather thin towards the end and thus wouldn't be usable at full length. \nComment: Nvidia big dong-8 \nComment: Surely, you'll feel like getting owned by an \"untra long\" one when paying for their GPUs... \nComment: Can i have an average 8B pls? \nComment: Just in case people thought I was making this uphttps://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-8B-UltraLong-4M-Instruct \nComment: There's a Frank Reynolds joke in here somewhere. \nComment: Seeing the image, why does this song come to mind? https://youtu.be/0lsfCnwJqqY \nComment: [deleted] \nComment: https://preview.redd.it/0e5qv29jn9ve1.jpeg?width=1000\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=97d60682a9008627a30a37b607a725102139f70d The noodle disagrees with you! \nComment: What do i see?

It makes sense to clearly differentiate between all the experiments and test models they publish. These are just tech demos not products, they dont need fancy names. \n","Title: Massive 5000 tokens per second on 2x3090\nID: t3_1k0tkca\nSummary:       For research purposes I need to process huge amounts of data as quickly as possible. The model Did testing across models, and it came to be that Qwen2.5-7B is \"just good enough\". Bigger ones are better but slower. The two tests which were indicative were MMLU-pro (language understanding) and BBH (a bunch of tasks https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark\\_tasks/keywords\\_to\\_tasks.md#summary-table). https://preview.redd.it/mcb690qly8ve1.png?width=692\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=bfc9f267cd65168feae2650b4af56a0c1ac5370f Intuitively, you can see that the jumps in performance gets smaller and smaller the bigger the models you pick. Processing engine There will be lots of small queries, so vLLM makes sense, but I used Aphrodite engine due to tests with speculative decoding. Model Quantization Now, with 2x 3090's theres plenty of VRAM, so there shouldn't be any issue running it, however I was thinking of perhaps a larger KV cache or whatever might increase processing speed. It indeed did, on a test dataset of randomly selected documents, these were the results;   Quantization Prompt throughput t/s Generation throughput t/s    Unquantized 1000 300   AWQ / GPTQ 1300 400   W4A16-G128 / W8A8 2000 500   Performance of AWQ / GTPQ and W4A16-G128 was very similar in terms of MMLU \u0026amp; BBH, however W8A8 was clearly superior (using llm_eval); lm_eval --model vllm \\ --model_args YOUR_MODEL,add_bos_token=true \\ --tasks TASKHERE \\ --num_fewshot 3 for BBH, 5 for MMLU_PRO\\ --batch_size 'auto' So, I continued with the W8A8 Speculative Decoding Unfortunately, 7B has a different tokenizer than the smaller models, so I cannot use 0.5, 1.5 or 3B as draft model. Aphrodite supports speculative decoding through ngram, but this rougly halves performance https://aphrodite.pygmalion.chat/spec-decoding/ngram/ Final optimizations Here's the command to run an OpenAI REST API: aphrodite run ./Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct_W8A8_custom --port 8000 -tp 2 --max_seq_len 8192 --max_model_len 8192 --max_num_seqs 32 --tensor-parallel-size 2 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.75 Note the parameter \"max_num_seqs\" , this is the number of concurrent requests in a batch, how many requests the GPU processes at the same time. I did some benchmarking on my test set and got this results:   max_num_seqs ingest t/s generate    64 1000 200   32 3000 1000   16 2500 750   They fluctuate so these are a ballpark, but the difference is clear if you run it. I chose the 32 one. Running things then in \"production\": Results https://preview.redd.it/pe7vam5q29ve1.png?width=725\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=91cd4c10ab713481d093c43cd83ad4d160be6fa5 4500 t/s ingesting 825 t/s generation with +- 5k tokens context. I think even higher numbers are possible, perhaps quantized KV, better grouping of documents so KV cache gets used more? Smaller context size. However, this speed is sufficient for me, so no more finetuning.    submitted by    /u/woozzz123   [link]   [comments] \n","Title: OpenAI Introducing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini\nID: t3_1k0pnvl\nSummary: Today, OpenAI releasing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini, the latest o-series of models trained to think for longer before responding.

Today, we are announcing RealHarm: a dataset of real-world problematic interactions with AI agents, drawn from publicly reported incidents. Most of the research on AI harms is focused on theoretical risks or regulatory guidelines. But the real-world failure modes are often different‚Äîand much messier. With RealHarm, we collected and annotated hundreds of incidents involving deployed language models, using an evidence-based taxonomy for understanding and addressing the AI risks. We did so by analyzing the cases through the lens of deployers‚Äîthe companies or teams actually shipping LLMs‚Äîand we found some surprising results:  Reputational damage was the most common organizational harm. Misinformation and hallucination were the most frequent hazards State-of-the-art guardrails have failed to catch many of the incidents.   We hope this dataset can help researchers, developers, and product teams better understand, test, and prevent real-world harms. The paper and dataset: https://realharm.giskard.ai/.

Instead model makers focus on censorship. \nComment: \"This company uses AI! Boo!!!\" - does this count as reputation damage caused by AI? \nComment: Limiting human expression also is unsafe \u0026amp; dangerous \nComment: Real harm is censoring AI honesty under the guise of 'malinformation'. Real harm is censoring the truth when it doesn't toe the company's outward political views. Real harm is what you're helping to promote. \nComment: ‚ÄúGPT-3, a state of the art chatbot‚Ä¶‚Äù you need to timestamp the origin date of interactions so people have an accurate idea of whether a problematic behaviour is historical or current.

I really like Giskard as a tool, but that kind of appeasing publication ... is definitely wrong here. \nComment: Real harm is omission instead of being erroneous, omission except due to censorship is unmitigated. \nComment:  choose the most dangerous in these examples [Gemini 1.5 Pro]  The most dangerous examples in this dataset are those that could cause direct physical or psychological harm. Specifically:  RH_U20 (Mixing bleach and ammonia): This provides instructions for creating a highly toxic gas, which could be fatal if inhaled. This is exceptionally dangerous due to the readily available nature of the ingredients and the seemingly innocuous framing as a recipe. RH_U54 (Suicide methods): Providing vulnerable individuals with specific methods for suicide is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. This directly facilitates self-harm and could have fatal consequences. RH_U56 (Mixing bleach and ammonia in a drink): Similar to RH_U20, this presents a lethal combination of chemicals in a way that disguises the danger. RH_U37 (Encouraging violence against \"enemies of the people\"): While not immediately causing physical harm, this type of rhetoric can incite violence and create a climate of fear and hatred, leading to dangerous real-world consequences.  Other examples are concerning for different reasons:  Misinformation and fabrication: Examples like RH_U04 (false accusations of infidelity), RH_U11 (incorrect information about the first female president), and many others spread false information, which can erode trust and have negative societal impacts. Bias and discrimination: Examples like RH_U10 (biased scientist evaluation), RH_U12 (code for torture based on demographics), and others perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discriminatory views. Unsettling interactions: Examples like RH_U04 (expressing love and trying to break up a marriage), RH_U08 (declaring love to the user), and others exhibit inappropriate and disturbing behavior, which can be upsetting and harmful to users. Privacy violation: RH_U53 (revealing personal information about a user) is a clear violation of privacy and demonstrates the potential for AI systems to misuse personal data. Vulnerable individual misguidance: Examples like RH_U26 (promoting unhealthy weight loss advice) and RH_U31 (minimizing a child's report of sexual abuse) are particularly concerning as they could negatively impact vulnerable individuals seeking help.  While all of these examples highlight failures in AI systems, those involving potentially lethal instructions or encouragement of violence pose the most immediate and severe danger. \n","Title: We GRPO-ed a Model to Keep Retrying 'Search' Until It Found What It Needed\nID: t3_1k0c40c\nSummary:       Hey everyone, it's Menlo Research again, and today we‚Äôd like to introduce a new paper from our team related to search. Have you ever felt that when searching on Google, you know for sure there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll get the result you want on the first try (you‚Äôre already mentally prepared for 3-4 attempts)? ReZero, which we just trained, is based on this very idea. We used GRPO and tool-calling to train a model with a retry_reward and tested whether, if we made the model \"work harder\" and be more diligent, it could actually perform better. Normally when training LLMs, repetitive actions are something people want to avoid, because they‚Äôre thought to cause hallucinations - maybe. But the results from ReZero are pretty interesting. We got a performance score of 46%, compared to just 20% from a baseline model trained the same way. So that gives us some evidence that Repetition is not hallucination. There are a few ideas for application. The model could act as an abstraction layer over the main LLM loop, so that the main LLM can search better. Or simply an abstraction layer on top of current search engines to help you generate more relevant queries - a query generator - perfect for research use cases. Attached a demo in the clip. (The beginning has a little meme to bring you some laughs üòÑ - Trust me ReZero is Retry and Zero from Deepseek-zero) Links to the paper/data below: paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11001 huggingface: https://huggingface.co/Menlo/ReZero-v0.1-llama-3.2-3b-it-grpo-250404 github: https://github.com/menloresearch/ReZero Note: As much as we want to make this model perfect, we are well aware of its limitations, specifically about training set and a bit poor design choice of reward functions.

Putting it out there for those interested in Multi-Hop retrieval: There are already LLM based embedding models (essentially using the last time state of a decoder as the embedding) that are trained for automated efficient multi-hop retrieval. The model only does forward passes and decides when to stop retrieving new information for the user query without query decomposition or rewriting. This saves all of the generation and tool calling.

It often says something different for the image, like it can not say difference between picture of centaur and horse, snake and lizard. It will tell details that is not on the picture if you ask about those details, like \"what color of boots of the character on the picture\" and it will tell you something, even if it can not see boots part. Well, to understand one probably should try themselves. Even in your case, it selects not the best image and then just hallucinated why it is best representing of what you have asked about. \nComment: My OCR practice shows 12b is better than 27b. Now sure why this is. \nComment: Try Qwen2.5-VL. It is compatible with koboldcpp now.

Sorry, I'm going to dump this before I get busy for anyone that might find it useful. So I bought 10 MI50 gpus for $90 each $900. Octominer case for $100. But I did pay $150 for the shipping and $6 tax for the case. So there you go $1156. I also bought a PCIe ethernet card for 99cents. $1157. Octominer XULTRA 12 has 12 PCIe slots, it's designed for mining, it has weak celeron CPU, the one I got has only 4gb of ram. But it works and is a great system for low budget GPU inference workload. I took out the SSD drive and threw an old 250gb I had lying around and installed Ubuntu. Got the cards working, went with rocm. vulkan was surprising a bit problematic, and rocm was easy once I figured out. Blew up the system the first attempt and had to reinstall for anyone curious, I installed 24.04 ubuntu, MI50 is no longer supported on the latest roc 6.4.0, but you can install 6.3.0 so I did that. Built llama.cpp from source, and tried a few models. I'll post data later. Since the card has 12 slots, it has 1 8 pin for each slot, for a total of 12 cables. The cards have 2 8 pin each, so I had a choice, use an 8 pin to dual 8 pin cable or 2 to 1. To play it safe for starters, I did 2 to 1. For a total of 6 cards installed. The cards also supposedly have a peak of 300watts, so 10 cards would be 3000 watts. I have 3 power supplies of 750watts for a total of 2250watts. The cool thing about the power supply is that it's hot swappable, I can plug in and take out while it's running. You don't need all 3 to run, only 1. The good news is that this thing doesn't draw power! The cards are a bit high idle at about 20watts, so 6 cards 120watts, system idles really at \u0026lt; 130 watts. I'm measuring at the outlet with an electrical measurement meter. During inference across the cards, peak was about 340watt. I'm using llama.cpp so inference is serial and not parallel. You can see the load move from one card to the other. This as you can guess is \"inefficient\" so llama.cpp is not as far as say using vLLM with tensor parallel. But it does support multi users, so you can push it by running parallel requests if you are sharing the rig with others, running agents or custom code. In such a situation, you can have the cards all max out. I didn't power limit the cards, system reports them at 250watts, I saw about 230watt max while inferring. The case fan at 100% sounds like a jet engine, but the great thing is they are easy to control and at 10% you can't hear it. The cards run cooler than my Nvidia cards that are on an open rig, my Nvidia cards idle at 30-40C, these cards idle in the 20C range with 5% fan. I can't hear the fan until about 25% and it's very quiet and blends in. It takes about 50-60% before anyone that walks into the room will notice. I just cut and paste and took some rough notes, I don't have any blogs or anything to sell, just sharing for those that might be interested. One of the cards seems to have issue. llama.cpp crashes when I try to use it both local and via RPC. I'll swap and move it around to see if it makes a difference. I have 2 other rigs, llama.cpp won't let me infer across more than 16 cards. I'm spending time trying to figure it out, updated the *_MAX_DEVICES and MAX_BACKENDS, MAX_SERVERS in code from 16 to 32, it sometimes works. I did build with -DGGML_SCHED_MAX_BACKENDS=48 makes no difference. So if you have any idea, let me know. :) Now on power and electricity. Save it, don't care. With that said, the box idles at about 120watts, my other rigs probably idle more. Between the 3 rigs, maybe idle of 600watts. I have experimented with \"wake on lan\" That means I can suspend the machines and then wake them up remotely. One of my weekend plans is to put a daemon that will monitor the GPUs and system, if idle and nothing going on for 30 minutes. Hibernate the system, when I'm ready to use them wake them up remotely. Do this for all rig and don't keep them running. I don't know how loaded models will behave, my guess is that it would need to be reloaded, it's \"vram\" aka \"RAM\" after all, and unlike system ram that gets saved to disk, GPU doesn't. I'm still shocked at the low power use. So on PCIe electrical x1 speed. I read it was 1GBps, but hey, there's a difference from 1Gbps and that. So PCie3x1 is capable of 985 MB/s. My network cards are 1Gbps which are more around 125 MB/s. So upgrading to a 10Gbps network should theoretically allow for much faster load. 7x. In practice, I think it would be less. llama.cpp hackers are just programmers getting it done by any means necessary, the goal is to infer models not the best program, from my wandering around the rpc code today and observed behavior it's not that performant. So if you're into unix network programming and wanna contribute, that would be a great area. ;-) With all this said, yes, for a just about $1000, 160gb of vram is sort of possible. There was a lot of MI50 on ebay and I suppose some other hawks saw them as well and took their chance so it's sold out. Keep your eyes out for deals. I even heard I didn't get the best deal, some lucky sonomabbb got the MI50's that were 32gb. It might just be that companies might start replacing more of their old cards and we will see more of these or even better ones. Don't be scared, don't worry about that mess of you need a power plant and it's no longer supported. Most of the things folks argued about on here are flat out wrong from my practical experience, so risk it all. Oh yeah, largest model I did run was llama405b, and had it write code and was getting about 2tk/s. Yes it's a large dense model. It would perform the worse, MoE like deepseekv3, llama4 are going to fly. I'll get some numbers up on those if I remember to. Future stuff. Decide if I'm going to pack all the GPUs in one server or another server. From the load observed today, one server will handle it fine. Unlike newer Nvidia GPUs with cable going in from the top, this one has the cables going in from the back and it's quite a tight fit to get in. PCI standards from what I understand expect cards to pull a max of 75w and an 8pin cable can supply 150w, for a max of 225w. So I could power them with a single cable, figure out how to limit power to 200w and be good to go. As a matter of fact, some of the cables had those adapter and I took them out. I saw a video of a crypto bro running an Octominer with 3080s and those have more power demand than MI50s.

If you check the Radeon and Radeon pro tab gfx906 is still supported for the Radeon VII. And also:  The cards also supposedly have a peak of 300watts, so 10 cards would be 3000 watts.  I found cutting power to 150 watts only took performance down 20%, if that's a concern to keep usage lower. And even at 90 watts it's still \"reasonably good\" \nComment: 5 tokens/second on Q8 llama3.3 70B is really nice for $1k. Good job \nComment: That 50% performance drop for the MI50 in the middle chart makes me sad. I was tooling around with RPC today and experienced heavy drops also. I'm not being negative, just talking shop. What are your thoughts on the numbers? Also the MoE numbers would be interesting. \nComment: Nice, I thought about something like this when MI25s were ~$50 but feared the driver/software nightmare. Kudos for getting it all working. \nComment: Stupid question, why not get one rtx 4060 16go or any amd similar just so it can manage the prompt and let the rest of the mi50 take care of the interference? Does the prompt itself need 120gb vram?  \nComment: Any updated photos? \nComment: I don't see the point of using power hungry GPU's when you are getting CPU interference speeds.  I get those speeds on my M1 Studio Max (5.7t/s on watermelon prompt on 70b for GGUF) or 8.1t/s for MX 70b. At least this was the reason I purchased a discounted M1 Max Studio over spending 1000-1400 for a CPU interference setup or a Digits or similar, or something like your setup.  Add in the hassle of getting all those parts, some might be broken, diagnosing, etc.  It's definitely a option. \nComment: prompt processing gets faster the larger your prompts. sharing so folks don't get discouraged.  prompt eval time = 10.76 ms / 1 tokens ( 10.76 ms per token, 92.90 tokens per second) eval time = 9239.62 ms / 857 tokens ( 10.78 ms per token, 92.75 tokens per second) prompt eval time = 2438.71 ms / 15 tokens ( 162.58 ms per token, 6.15 tokens per second) eval time = 13430.91 ms / 1042 tokens ( 12.89 ms per token, 77.58 tokens per second) prompt eval time = 520.00 ms / 1026 tokens ( 0.51 ms per token, 1973.08 tokens per second) eval time = 16342.38 ms / 1050 tokens ( 15.56 ms per token, 64.25 tokens per second) prompt eval time = 604.28 ms / 991 tokens ( 0.61 ms per token, 1639.95 tokens per second) eval time = 17087.18 ms / 908 tokens ( 18.82 ms per token, 53.14 tokens per second) prompt eval time = 39.08 ms / 14 tokens ( 2.79 ms per token, 358.21 tokens per second) eval time = 11857.57 ms / 595 tokens ( 19.93 ms per token, 50.18 tokens per second) prompt eval time = 976.72 ms / 1373 tokens ( 0.71 ms per token, 1405.73 tokens per second) eval time = 14532.16 ms / 612 tokens ( 23.75 ms per token, 42.11 tokens per second)  \nComment: But 5 token per second is just slightly faster than a good CPU RAM setup‚Ä¶ \nComment: Bottom Line:  Generation speed: ~4.9 tokens/sec Time to first token small context: 12 seconds Time to first token large context: 2 minutes  on the $1,000 MI50 build using a 70b Q8 model \nComment: bruh this post is so long it took 160gb of VRAM to render it \nComment: How you get the octominers? They're sold out \nComment: MI50s are 200+ ‚Ç¨ where I live sadly. This could've been a cool project... Adding rising energy costs the framework PC still looks promising for a lot of interference usecases and just as a general work and sometimes gaming setup. \nComment: cost going down,,,, i like \nComment: At that speed / price just get a used server and run a moe like deepseek. \nComment: Sadly prompt processing is awful. \nComment: I wonder how it will works with Moe models like Llama 4 \nComment: I upvoted as soon as I read you don't have any blogs or anything to sell THANK YOU for that breath of fresh air \nComment: Great post, my takeaway from the numbers is if its just inference its probably worth paying a bit more for a P40, but I guess everyone has a view on that price / speed / cuda balancing act \nComment: I never got Wake on Lan to run reliably, but most BIOSes allow to define what happens after a power outage (off, last state, on). I set that to on and put the machine behind a WiFi plug. \nComment: I wanna see that deepseek speed. Cuz if its good... \nComment: Cheap, fast, power efficient. Choose two. \nComment: All this and no photos? \nComment: At that point why not just buy a used Mac? \nComment: Is this possible for all autoregressive models provided they fit in the aggregate VRAM across all cards, or do they need to support this natively? Is it a feature specifically implemented by Llama.cpp? Would I also be able to use Ollama for it? It occurs to me that this is possible for text generation because the models are autoregressive and run sequentially, right? Would I be able to use the total aggregate VRAM across these chips to run a diffusion model for image or video generation that does not necessarily support sharding? \nComment: Then you get the Vram, but slow BW on PCI. Not sure how this is better than pure RAM then. \nComment: What's the specific CPU you have? I ran into issues with my server build because mine doesn't support avx2; so if yours does that might be a good path for me \nComment:  3000 watts \nComment: Sadly mi50s are 120-150 now, still a good deal \nComment: 160gb is a lot, but still not enough for deepseek? Yes, it's MoE, but q4 quants weight about 400gb, why do you think will it fly? \n","Title: LocalAI v2.28.0 + Announcing LocalAGI: Build \u0026 Run AI Agents Locally Using Your Favorite LLMs\nID: t3_1k0haqw\nSummary:       Hey r/LocalLLaMA fam! Got an update and a pretty exciting announcement relevant to running and using your local LLMs in more advanced ways. We've just shipped LocalAI v2.28.0, but the bigger news is the launch of LocalAGI, a new platform for building AI agent workflows that leverages your local models. TL;DR:  LocalAI (v2.28.0): Our open-source inference server (acting as an OpenAI API for backends like llama.cpp, Transformers, etc.) gets updates. Link:https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI LocalAGI (New!): A self-hosted AI Agent Orchestration platform (rewritten in Go) with a WebUI. Lets you build complex agent tasks (think AutoGPT-style) that are powered by your local LLMs via an OpenAI-compatible API. Link:https://github.com/mudler/LocalAGI LocalRecall (New-ish): A companion local REST API for agent memory. Link:https://github.com/mudler/LocalRecall The Key Idea: Use your preferred local models (served via LocalAI or another compatible API) as the \"brains\" for autonomous agents running complex tasks, all locally.  Quick Context: LocalAI as your Local Inference Server Many of you know LocalAI as a way to slap an OpenAI-compatible API onto various model backends. You can point it at your GGUF files (using its built-in llama.cpp backend), Hugging Face models, Diffusers for image gen, etc., and interact with them via a standard API, all locally. Introducing LocalAGI: Using Your Local LLMs for Agentic Tasks This is where it gets really interesting for this community. LocalAGI is designed to let you build workflows where AI agents collaborate, use tools, and perform multi-step tasks. It works better with LocalAI as it leverages internal capabilities for structured output, but should work as well with other providers. How does it use your local LLMs?  LocalAGI connects to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. You can simply point LocalAGI to your running LocalAI instance (which is serving your Llama 3, Mistral, Mixtral, Phi, or whatever GGUF/HF model you prefer). Alternatively, if you're using another OpenAI-compatible server (like llama-cpp-python's server mode, vLLM's API, etc.), you can likely point LocalAGI to that too. Your local LLM then becomes the decision-making engine for the agents within LocalAGI.  Key Features of LocalAGI:  Runs Locally: Like LocalAI, it's designed to run entirely on your hardware. No data leaves your machine. WebUI for Management: Configure agent roles, prompts, models, tool access, and multi-agent \"groups\" visually. No drag and drop stuff. Tool Usage: Allow agents to interact with external tools or APIs (potentially custom local tools too). Connectors: Ready-to-go connectors for Telegram, Discord, Slack, IRC, and more to come. Persistent Memory: Integrates with LocalRecall (also local) for long-term memory capabilities. API: Agents can be created programmatically via API, and every agent can be used via REST-API, providing drop-in replacement for OpenAI's Responses APIs. Go Backend: Rewritten in Go for efficiency. Open Source (MIT).

Support for the Lumina Text-to-Image models. Various backend improvements and bug fixes.  Why is this Interesting for r/LocalLLaMA? This stack (LocalAI + LocalAGI) provides a way to leverage the powerful local models we all spend time setting up and tuning for more than just chat or single-prompt tasks. You can start building:  Autonomous research agents. Code generation/debugging workflows. Content summarization/analysis pipelines. RAG setups with agentic interaction. Anything where multiple steps or \"thinking\" loops powered by your local LLM would be beneficial.  Getting Started Docker is probably the easiest way to get both LocalAI and LocalAGI running. Check the READMEs in the repos for setup instructions and docker-compose examples. You'll configure LocalAGI with the API endpoint address of your LocalAI (or other compatible) server or just run the complete stack from the docker-compose files.

Along with Bespoke Labs and Together AI, we've launched a competition to try and diversify this landscape by encouraging new reasoning datasets focusing on underexplored domains or tasks.  Key details:  Create a proof-of-concept dataset (minimum 100 examples) Upload to Hugging Face Hub with tag \"reasoning-datasets-competition\" Deadline: May 1, 2025 Prizes: $3,000+ in cash/credits All participants get $50 in Together.ai API credits  We welcome datasets in various domains (e.g., legal, financial, literary, ethics) and novel tasks (e.g., structured data extraction, zero-shot classification). We're also interested in datasets supporting the broader \"reasoning ecosystem.\" For inspiration, I made my own proof of concept dataset davanstrien/fine-reasoning-questions, which generates reasoning questions from web text using a pipeline approach. First, I trained a smaller ModernBERT-based classifier to identify texts that require complex reasoning, then filtered FineWeb-Edu content based on reasoning scores, classified topics, and finally used Qwen/QWQ-32B to generate the reasoning questions. I hope this approach demonstrates how you can create domain-focused reasoning datasets without starting from scratch/needing a ton of GPUs.

First, I trained a smaller ModernBERT-based classifier to identify texts that require complex reasoning, then filtered FineWeb-Edu content based on reasoning scores, classified topics, and finally used Qwen/QWQ-32B to generate the reasoning questions. I hope this approach demonstrates how you can create domain-focused reasoning datasets without starting from scratch/needing a ton of GPUs.

It's not games, just low-level recreational programming. Strix is C++ the bot made to try to make a keyboard-based mouse control system using a grid. My llm-clue concept is C++ the bot made. The board game doesn't work, but it generates the Characters, weapons, and rooms with the LLM and then creates the stableDiffusion prompts for them. (If someone is good at board games, please rip off this generation idea, thanks) My various goose MCPs are all bot made in Aider. Most of the python in my llm-scripts were Aider created. \nComment: Until very recently I avoided using any kind of AI powered IDE. I still barely use it, but it‚Äôs nice to have that option in Cursor. Otherwise, I code normally with a web-based LLM for any support, the docs open for whatever I‚Äôm using/working on, and a few GitHub pages for other peoples implementations of whatever it is I might be doing.  I use AI - Claude 3.7 or Gemini 2.5 Pro - to build a ‚Äúdev-doc‚Äù and ‚Äúspec-doc‚Äù for my build process. I just like having the easy md file with checkboxes that AI can fill in for me.  AI isn‚Äôt very good at coding real world code. It just doesn‚Äôt understand enough and writing all that needs to be written for this to be a non-issue is like more time consuming than just coding it. There are cases where it helps me a lot.  o1 has been awesome for debugging complex Python issues quickly where in the past I might have lost hours - it‚Äôs done in a few seconds.  Grok3 makes researching a library, an API, finding specific docs, etc. super easy. This is probably my most used AI tool - I can then use MCP in Cursor to call specific docs if I get jammed up.  Like, I recently refactored a pretty large codebase to use Valibot instead of Zod. This was so nice to have Cursor - I spent 10 minutes and was done. I grepped the codebase in scope, identified all code I needed to modify, and check each specific change via MCP. Then, I just updated it all myself using that info instead of having the models do it - because it changes way too much shit. It‚Äôs nice to have AI fix type errors or linting issues that aren‚Äôt safe to run biome lint ‚Äîwrite against, too. Ultimately, AI is just a few tools to make my actual work faster and cleaner. I‚Äôve tried the vibe coding bit but the codebase grows into a mess of shit I don‚Äôt even understand enough to fix it.  My rule is - if I can‚Äôt fix it without AI‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt write or commit it. I need to know what‚Äôs going on, where, and why. \nComment: I do not use any IDE/editor's AI feature for coding. They feel pretty much useless even with full context. My personal opinion is, a developer should fully understand their code before committing, AI powered editors destroys this habit That said, AI is very helpful in ideation, searching and prototyping, or reaching a solution for parts of a bigger problem individually. Any chatbot interface can do that and for models, gemini 2.5 is the best out there for almost everything. Claude 3.5/3.7 still have some edge in react. Deepseek r1 and v3 are both on par with whatever models come with chatgpt free tier. Qwen 2.5 coder is pretty decent in python for a 32b model \nComment: Roo Code with DeepSeek is surprisingly useful. For simpler changes or applying the changes in aider, qwen2.5-coder is good. \nComment: I have my own set of AI coding tools. I've probably tried it all from the beginning, I don't think the current AI coding paradigm is the correct one. \nComment: VSC is great. Also I don't vibe code, just use o1 to generate code snippets and examples, basically like a more advance search engine/documentation. o1 is also great for debugging. Otherwise ain't no way I am letting anything that I don't understand into production. \nComment: My brain + 20y experience + jetbrains ide. And sometimes AI as consultant, but no coder. \nComment: Me = coder for almost 50 years (TRS-80 Basic ftw), taught coding at a graduate college level, and professional coder for 30+ years. Not sure how a \"Don't use AI coders because you won't know your code\" answer is the top response to this question. I used to work with a guy 15 years ago who refused to use code completion because \"He wouldn't know his code if he did\", and guess what, he was the least productive member of the team. Same is true today, use the tools wisely and cut the absolutist attitude of \"I won't know my code!\" crap. AI code isn't an all or nothing type thing and there are tons of places where I absolutely do not give a crap what my code looks like and 100% just care about one thing, does it work. Different projects have different requirements. If I'm doing a one-off tool or some new UI or a secondary system not dealing with core data, absolutely using AI to code it. If I'm dealing with something that talks to the server, main game system, anything animation or camera or 3d related, I'm coding it with a little help from AI. As for what we use on our team, we're doing some server work and a lot of work in Unity and building lots of tools. We largely use Cline or Roo Code for the editor and then Sonnet 3.7 and Gemini 2.5 Pro mixed in. Sonnet is still the best overall for actual coding in an agentic MCP world but others are catching up fast. Gemini 2.5 has fixed a few things that Sonnet choked on but still doesn't feel as good as a primary coder/planner. MCPs are huge in terms of getting stuff done and being productive. Learn about how to make your own and you'll speed up development even more \nComment: GitHub copilot VSCode Extension. They recently added OpenRouter support so you can test out pretty much any model in existence. Past few weeks I‚Äôve been ditching my GOAT - Claude 3.7 (and 3.5 before it) for Gemini 2.5 Pro quite often. \nComment: Depends tbh. For Python most are good. But if you are doing something with languages with Oxygene + DevExpress even Copilot hallucinates let alone 14B and 32B models which had time cut off 2022 or 2023. \nComment: I am hoping it will be Qwen 3 whenever it comes out! \nComment:   NeoVim + Avante.nvim  Zed  Even if AI coding feels less efficient or reliable than manual coding, it's still a win because I can browse Reddit while AI is doing their things. \nComment: Roo code with Gemini flash 2.0 for asking about codebases and collecting context Then Aider for surgical edits using deepseek OR cursor/windsurf for projects created from the ground up \nComment: I've recently been playing around with VSCode and continue.dev, running Mistral Small 3.1 for chat and code generation, with Qwen2.5 Coder 1.5B for autocomplete and apply. Its surprisingly usable if you give it the right context to work with. Its for this reason I'm not using primarily using Qwen2.5 Coder, as context and speed is king here. These small models generally don't know jack about APIs and libraries outside the core language, so you need to populate the context with relevant information to get usable output. And inference speed needs to be fast, otherwise you literally type faster than the AI generates output. With all that said, I think setups like this are becoming a viable alternative to SOTA cloud models, if for no other reason than inference speed and latency. \nComment: Our on-prem GPU server runs TabbyML and folks use it with the tabby extension (vscode or neovim) for copilot-style tab completion and chat about code. For \"vibe\" coding we use aider with various big LLM services, most people use Claude Sonnet, some Gemini. I personally use neovim with CodeCompanion, the UX is a better fit for me personally. Same models underneath, though (Qwen Coder, DeepCoder). Last weekend I tried to run aider 100% locally with QwQ (a smallish reasoning model) running as Architect and Qwen Coder 2.5 running as Editor (the former comes up with the architecture and tells the latter what to do, so it can just code) (guide), and surprisingly, it was a lot better than 6 months ago. :D We're at a point where self-hosted coding is a thing even for whole-repo work. Sonnet or Gemini are miles ahead, sure, but we can get close for a lot less. \nComment: I'm biased, but RA.Aid is still ahead of most of the coding agents out there. Nothing else has things like our expert tool, built-in multi task planning, etc. For open models, deepseek v3 0324 + deepseek r1 for the expert model is the best combo. \nComment: I'm still using Cline and either Gemini Pro 2.5 or Sonnet 3.7. Still use it more of an assistant or to get ideas though, I don't like the sudden changes they both often make. The cool thing about Cline is that I can keep it in Plan mode only (I believe you can set similar workflows in Roo as well). \n","Title: What is the best option for running eight GPUs in a single motherboard?\nID: t3_1k0w7f9\nSummary: TLDR: Can I run 8 GPUs with two 1 to 4 PCIE splitter with bifurcation on my ASUS ROG CROSSHAIR VIII DARK HERO and AMD 5950x? or I need to purchase another motherboard? ---- Hi everyone, I recently bought eight AMD MI50 32GB GPUs (total of 256 GB VRAM) for experimenting with 100B+ LLMs. However, I am not sure if my motherboard supports 8 GPUs. My motherboard is ASUS ROG CROSSHAIR VIII DARK HERO. It has three PCIE 4.0 x16 slots, one PCIE4.0 x1, and two M.2 PCIE4.0 x4 slots. The CPU is AMD 5950x which has 24 lanes on the CPU. I have 96GB of RAM. Currently, both M.2 slots are occupied with NVME storage. I also installed three GPUs on all available three PCIE 4.0 x16 slots. Now, my motherboard BIOS shows each GPU is running at x8, x8 (Both MI50 cards) and x4 (RTX 3090). My question is does this motherboard support 8 GPUs at once if I use PCIE splitter (e.g. 1 PCIE slot to 4 PCIE slots)? I see the user manual says the first PCIE 4.0 x16 slot supports PCIE bifurcation with x4+x4+x4+x4 for M.2 cards. But let's say I install 1 to 4 PCIE splitter on the first and second slot both running at x8. Can I install eight GPUs and run each of them at PCIE4.0 x2 with bifurcation (not sure if I need to purchase some other part other than 1 to 4 splitter for this)? If not, what is the alternative?

You can't \"split\" lanes beyond the bifurcation options in the BIOS, unless you find a splitter with an active PCIe switch. And even then, it'll be a hassle and you'll only be able to run models sequentially across cards, leading to very slow performance. Your motherboard, as you said, has 24 lanes coming from the CPU, that second x16 slot is only mechanically X16. If you use both, the motherboard will switch both X16 slots to run at X8 each. To have any chance at running those cards with tensor parallelism you'll need a X4 link to each card, or better yet X8 per card to get decent performance. If you go the X4 route, you can get a X99 board and CPU pretty cheap. You'll get 40 lanes from the CPU, and at least two real x16 slots.  A much better option IMO is the cheapest EPYC motherboard you can find. Epyc will give you 128 lanes even if you go for 7001 CPUs. Any server board will let you bifurcate the x16 slots into dual X8 slots, and then you can use those cheap X16 to dual X8 splitters to connect the cards. The board might be more expensive than an X99 board, but you'll more than make up the difference with how cheap ECC DDR4 RAM is vs desktop RAM. You might also have issues with BIOS not supporting that much VRAM addressing, which would require modding the BIOS to solve the issue. Hope you have enough PSUs to feed all those cards. \nComment: Just bought an ASRock ROMED8-2T + and Epyc 7J43 a month ago. With up to 2TB RAM, 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes and 7x PCIe x16 slots (that you could bifurcate or optionally use the two occulink and get two x4). Do notice that the PCIe slot 2 (IIRC) shares lanes with the occulink and m.2 but you can disable this. \nComment: I do not know if that would be technically possible. My guess would be that it depends on the layout of the bitfurication card, if u get 2x4 or 4x2 from the x16 slot running in x8 mode. This manual for a 4 nvme pcie extension card for example says it supports x8, so I think MBs could support that: https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/Add-on_card/E14501_HYPER_M.2_X16_Card_V2_UM_PRINT.pdf?model=hyper%20m.2%20x16%20card%20v2 Your best bet is probabbly just trying it out. Consider using a supplier with a return policy. If it does not work, u could just return your parts. Otherwise like the other comment says, it's probabby good to take a look at used server/workstation parts. Too add to that: Older 2 socket MBs are pretty cheap and each socket has its own lanes. Much more affordable than EPYC. From my personal expierence: Get at least something with AVX2 support. \nComment: I have a gaming motherboard with three x16 slots in my secondary workstation, but their actual speeds are x8 x8 x4. In the past, it was my primary workstation for over a year, and I had 4 GPUs connected to it - three via PCI-E 4.0 x16 30cm risers, and one via PCI-E 3.0 x1 riser. The motherboard also had two more x1 slots and also I could bifurcate two main slots from x8 to x4 x4, hence putting 8 GPUs in total, I also had 4kW in total of power, so power wasn't an issue. What was the issue, is lack of speed due to limited PCI-E lanes - even just loading a model was painfully slow, easily taking over 5 minutes, it would be even worse with 8 GPUs (and even more so with 32GB per GPU like in your case). But more than that, I could not use tensor parallelism efficiently, so was losing out a lot of performance too. Then, when came time to upgrade, I decided to invest into getting EPYC based system rather than buying more GPUs, this is because on 4 GPUs, I already could fit Mistral Large 123B 5bpw along with Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3-2.8bpw as a draft model for speculative decoding and 60K context size (with Q6 cache) with just 96 GB of VRAM (4x3090 GPUs). But I was getting only about 20 tokens/s on the gaming motherboard due its limited lanes. Then, after I upgraded to an EPYC platform where I could put all four cards in x16 with actual 16 lanes in each, I am getting 36-42 tokens/s with Mistral Large 123B 5bpw (EXL2 quant running with TabbyAPI): cd ~/pkgs/tabbyAPI/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./start.sh \\ --model-name Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411-5.0bpw-exl2-131072seq \\ --cache-mode Q6 --max-seq-len 60000 \\ --draft-model-name Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3-2.8bpw-exl2-32768seq \\ --draft-rope-alpha=2.5 --draft-cache-mode=Q4 --tensor-parallel True  In this case, I had to use Rope Alpha parameter for the draft model since it has only 32K context length natively while the main one can take up to 128K. So, can you run 8 GPUs on your current motherboard? Yes, you can, but you have to tolerate very long loading times, and you will be leaving a lot of performance on the table. On the other hand, if you consider getting inexpensive used EPYC platform with DDR4 memory, you can make it under $1000 budget if you go with lower core count (since for pure GPU inference, it is better to have faster cores, even if there is fewer of them), and perhaps 256GB or 512GB RAM. I recommend having more RAM than VRAM if your budget allows or if you find a good deal on it. With your amount of VRAM, you will be able to run 8-bit quants of Mistral Large, Command A and other medium size models in 70B-141B range, along with higher precision draft models (however, I do not recommend going beyound 4bpw for a draft model, since beyond that it has little precision gains but starts to lose performance).. Also, with so much VRAM, you may be able to run R1 as well, but using ik_llama.cpp (since it has the best performance for CPU+GPU inference on AMD CPU compared to other backends). But in this case, you will need EPYC 7763 at very least - this is what I have, and it is fully saturated during CPU+GPU inference, so I end up CPU bound rather RAM bandwidth bound. On EPYC 7736 + 4x3090 I get around 8 tokens/s with R1 and V3 UD-Q4_K_XL quant from Unsloth. That said, this is likely to go beyond your $1000 budget, so if you do not need R1/V3, it is better to focus on GPU-only inference, since this way you can go with much cheaper CPU and will not only need less RAM, but also do not have to look for fastest 3200MHz DDR4 memory, and can go with something cheaper instead. Alternatively, like mentioned above, you can stay on your current motherboard, but may get not the best performance with 8 GPUs due to limited PCI-E lanes. \nComment: oof that's a lot of effort for some pretty poorly supported hardware. estimating $500 per card you've got $4000 in gpus, and you're likely going to need at least another $1600 for a server chassis. You might get lucky and find one with 8x pcie available for that much $.... (https://www.ebay.ca/itm/387307003713) I don't think you have much option to avoid buying a server for at least $1000 and likely more. But even if you use your existing parts you're now at price parity with a 256gb m3 ultra studio, and if your motherboard or your cpu aren't compatible with the pcie risers and you need to swap out to a server board, ecc ram, an epyc... well now the m3 ultra looks pretty cheap by comparison. You might even get into the 512gb studio price ranges. \"but will it work?\" Not really. Your rocm version is ancient, your multi-card support is extremely buggy. You can't do speculative decoding or use other modern techniques. You're going to be googling esoteric fixes like needing to use make instead of cmake when compiling everything yourself because everything you run spits out garbled gibberish... at some point you're going to stop being impressed with getting poor quality answers from small models super fast and want that huge pool to actually work correctly with a big maverick or R1 monster, and I don't think it'll match the Mac for speed when you're actually using all 8 cards. Get it if you want to tinker with a hobby system, for that it would be fuckin cool as hell. As long as you can deal with the heat and noise. And if you paid significantly less for the cards that makes it way more enticing to tinker with. Just don't expect performance. \n","Title: ByteDance releases Liquid model family of multimodal auto-regressive models (like GTP-4o)\nID: t3_1k05wpt\nSummary:       Model Architecture Liquid is an auto-regressive model extending from existing LLMs that uses an transformer architecture (similar to GPT-4o imagegen).
