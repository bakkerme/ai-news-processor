The most critical point I&amp;#39;ve observed during this process is: Agentic transformation will be a painful process, just like digital transformation. What I learned in the field:üëá&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1- Definitions related to artificial intelligence are not yet standardized. Even the definition of &amp;quot;AI agent&amp;quot; differs between parties in meetings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2- Organizations typically develop simple agents. They are far from achieving real-world transformation. To transform a job that generates ROI, an average of 20 agents need to work together or separately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3- Companies initially want to produce a basic working prototype. Everyone is ready to allocate resources after seeing real ROI. But there&amp;#39;s an important point. High performance is expected from small models running on a small amount of GPU, and the success of these models is naturally low. Therefore, they can&amp;#39;t get out of the test environment and the business turns into a chicken-and-egg problem.üê•&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4- Another important point in agentic transformation is that significant changes need to be made in the use of existing tools according to the agent to be built. Actions such as UI changes in used applications and providing new APIs need to be taken. This brings many arrangements with it.üå™Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è An important problem we encounter with agents is the excitement about agents. This situation causes us to raise our expectations from agents. There are two critical points to pay attention to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1- Avoid using agents unnecessarily. Don&amp;#39;t try to use agents for tasks that can be solved with software. Agents should be used as little as possible. Because software is deterministic - we can predict the next step with certainty. However, we cannot guarantee 100% output quality from agents. Therefore, we should use agents only at points where reasoning is needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2- Due to MCP and Agent excitement, we see technologies being used in the wrong places. There&amp;#39;s justified excitement about MCP in the sector. We brought MCP support to our framework in the first month it was released, and we even prepared a special page on our website explaining the importance of MCP when it wasn&amp;#39;t popular yet. MCP is a very important technology. However, this should not be forgotten: if you can solve a problem with classical software methods, you shouldn&amp;#39;t try to solve it using tool calls (MCP or agent) or LLM. It&amp;#39;s necessary to properly orchestrate the technologies and concepts emerging with agents.üéª&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can properly orchestrate agents and choose the right agentic transformation points, productivity increases significantly with agents. At one of our clients, a job that took 1 hour was reduced to 5 minutes. The 5 minutes also require someone to perform checks related to the work done by the Agent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Beneficial-Sir-6261&quot;&gt; /u/Beneficial-Sir-6261 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1llsztp/what_i_learned_building_agents_for_enterprises/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1llsztp/what_i_learned_building_agents_for_enterprises/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1llsztp</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1llsztp/what_i_learned_building_agents_for_enterprises/" /><updated>2025-06-27T12:46:41+00:00</updated><published>2025-06-27T12:46:41+00:00</published><title>What I Learned Building Agents for Enterprises</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/bearded__jimbo</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/bearded__jimbo</uri></author><category term="LocalLLaMA" label="r/LocalLLaMA" /><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am surprised you are able to use any form of AI within the banking sector.
