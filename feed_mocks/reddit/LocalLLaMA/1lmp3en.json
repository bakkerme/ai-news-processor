      "body": "That is great. Day 0 support is always greatly appreciated. I find it interesting that it was contributed by an ARM employee rather than a Baidu engineer. I guess they've started to seed the model to select partners ahead of time which makes sense.\n\nI'm quite excited for this release. Accessing ERNIE models outside of China is not trivial, and this is as far as I know the first open model Baidu has released. They claim it beats OpenAI's 4o on most metrics both when it comes to text and multimodality, which is a claim I'm often skeptical about, but given this is Baidu we are talking about I'm cautiously optimistic.",
