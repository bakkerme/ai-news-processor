Even if some scenarios regress, having someone out there tinkering with possible ways to further speed up decoding gets me excited; I honestly thought we'd hit the limit of what kind of speed we'd see on the Mac side by way of prompt processing, so just knowing you're out there doing this makes me really happy.\n\nYou mention specifically the requirements being the 0.6b; is that just to repeat your results and it could theoretically work on the larger models, or is it very specific to the 0.6b atm?",
