      "body": "In practical day to day Systems Engineering usage, r1-0528 has been hard to beat. Particularly with a back end like Fireworks.AI which is very fast. From time to time I'll check against Claude Sonnet or GPT, but Deepseek feels like it always gives me better results.\n\nI haven't really used Opus or the higher end GPT models though. They may be amazing, but the inference costs are kind of crazy. I have entire teams at work using Deepseek via OpenWebUI + Fireworks and we're spending around $5 a month.",
