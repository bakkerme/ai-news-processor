Most straightforward setup I know is for MNN app, which has Qwen Omni 3B model.  (You need to have more than 8gb ram to run that model).\n\n\nhttps://github.com/alibaba/MNN/blob/master/apps%2FAndroid%2FMnnLlmChat%2FREADME.md\n\n\nAlso, you can take a look at this, works fine on my entry level android. (most likely because it doesn't send context, each input is a standalone query to the llm, so no conversation, just a one time voice query) \n\n\nhttps://github.com/alibaba/MNN/blob/master/apps%2FAndroid%2FMnnTaoAvatar%2FREADME.md",
