      "body": "Thanks.  No matter how big the hosting / serving entity history and logic shows that ultimately if it's just a single corporate project or personal project that over the years it'll become deprioritized, abandoned, shut down, and then millions of person-hours of UGC effort \u0026amp; information could vanish without any mirror / preservation.  Yahoo, google, aol, compuserve, etc. all have done this one way or another.\n\nIt's fundamentally a mistake (for the users' best interests of information access \u0026amp; preservation) to centralize the content onto any single entity's services / servers as opposed to something that distributes all content widely and puts the choice in the hands of the readers' how / where they get and interact with the content e.g. usenet, mailing lists, openly syndicated / federated independent systems, whatever.",
