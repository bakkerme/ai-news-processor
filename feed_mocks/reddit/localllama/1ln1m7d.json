      "body": "There isnâ€™t really a single open source model that does all that natively. But you can kind of build your own pipeline. Use Whisper for transcription. Then feed that into something like Parselmouth or Gentle for prosody and timing. From there you could send it into a local LLM like Mistral. It's a bit of a DIY setup but totally doable if you're okay with some tweaking.",
