My priors are low though, seems like current gen lacks parity in several layers (reasoning over long horizon, tool use) with industry standard. But surely worth taking time and going for it now when next gen of qwen-coder wouldn't likely happen again this year (unlike Misanthropic, their flagship isn't basically just a coder model).",
