      "body": "All feedback is welcome! I am learning how to do better everyday.\n\nI went down the LLM rabbit hole trying to find the **best local model** that runs *well* on a humble MacBook Air M1 with just 8GB RAM.\n\nMy goal? **Compare 10 models** across question generation, answering, and self-evaluation.\n\nTL;DR: Some models were brilliant, others… not so much. One even took **8 minutes** to write a question.\n\nHere's the breakdown \n\n**Models Tested**\n\n* Mistral 7B\n* DeepSeek-R1 1.5B\n* Gemma3:1b\n* Gemma3:latest\n* Qwen3 1.7B\n* Qwen2.5-VL 3B\n* Qwen3 4B\n* LLaMA 3.2 1B\n* LLaMA 3.2 3B\n* LLaMA 3.1 8B\n\n(All models run with quantized versions, via: os.environ\\[\"OLLAMA\\_CONTEXT\\_LENGTH\"\\] = \"4096\" and os.environ\\[\"OLLAMA\\_KV\\_CACHE\\_TYPE\"\\] = \"q4\\_0\")\n\n **Methodology**\n\nEach model:\n\n1. Generated 1 question on 5 topics: *Math, Writing, Coding, Psychology, History*\n2. Answered all 50 questions (5 x 10)\n3. Evaluated every answer (including their own)\n\nSo in total:\n\n* 50 questions\n* 500 answers\n* 4830 evaluations (Should be 5000; I evaluated less answers with qwen3:1.7b and qwen3:4b as they do not generate scores and take a lot of time\\*\\*)\\*\\*\n\nAnd I tracked:\n\n* token generation speed (tokens/sec)\n* tokens created\n* time taken\n* scored all answers for quality\n\n**Key Results**\n\n**Question Generation**\n\n* Fastest: **LLaMA 3.2 1B**, **Gemma3:1b**, **Qwen3 1.7B** (LLaMA 3.2 1B hit 82 tokens/sec, avg is \\~40 tokens/sec (for english topic question it reached **146 tokens/sec)**\n* Slowest: **LLaMA 3.1 8B**, **Qwen3 4B**, **Mistral 7B** Qwen3 4B took **486s** (8+ mins) to generate a single Math question!\n* Fun fact: deepseek-r1:1.5b, qwen3:4b and Qwen3:1.7B  output \u0026lt;think\u0026gt; tags in questions\n\n**Answer Generation**\n\n* Fastest: **Gemma3:1b**, **LLaMA 3.2 1B** and **DeepSeek-R1 1.5B**\n* DeepSeek got faster answering *its own* questions (80 tokens/s vs. avg 40 tokens/s)\n* Qwen3 4B generates **2–3x more tokens** per answer\n* Slowest: llama3.1:8b, qwen3:4b and mistral:7b\n\n **Evaluation**\n\n* Best scorer: Gemma3:latest – consistent, numerical, no bias\n* Worst scorer: **DeepSeek-R1 1.5B** – often skipped scores entirely\n* Bias detected: Many models **rate their own answers higher**\n* DeepSeek even evaluated some answers **in Chinese**\n* I did think of creating a control set of answers. I could tell the mdoel this is the perfect answer basis this rate others. But I did not because it would need support from a lot of people- creating perfect answer, which still can have a bias. I read a few answers and found most of them decent except math. So I tried to find which model's evaluation scores were closest to the average to determine a decent model for evaluation tasks(check last image)\n\n**Fun Observations**\n\n* Some models create \u0026lt;think\u0026gt; tags for questions, answers and even while evaluation as output\n* Score inflation is real: Mistral, Qwen3, and LLaMA 3.1 8B overrate themselves\n* Score formats vary wildly (text explanations vs. plain numbers)\n* Speed isn’t everything – some slower models gave much higher quality answers\n\nBest Performers (My Picks)\n\n|Task|Best Model|Why|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|Question Gen|LLaMA 3.2 1B|Fast \u0026amp; relevant|\n|Answer Gen|Gemma3:1b|Fast, accurate|\n|Evaluation|LLaMA 3.2 3B|Generates numerical scores and evaluations closest to model average|\n\n# Worst Surprises\n\n|Task|Model|Problem|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|Question Gen|Qwen3 4B|Took 486s to generate 1 question|\n|Answer Gen|LLaMA 3.1 8B|Slow|\n|Evaluation|DeepSeek-R1 1.5B|Inconsistent, skipped scores|\n\n  \n\n\n**Screenshots Galore**\n\nI’m adding screenshots of:\n\n* Questions generation\n* Answer comparisons\n* Evaluation outputs\n* Token/sec charts\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n* You **can** run decent LLMs locally on M1 Air (8GB) – if you pick the right ones\n* Model size ≠ performance. Bigger isn't always better.\n* 5 Models have a self bais, they rate their own answers higher than average scores. attaching screen shot of a table. Diagonal is their own evaluation, last column is average.\n* Models' evaluation has high variance! Every model has a unique distribution of the scores it gave.\n\n\n\nPost questions if you have any, I will try to answer.\n\nHappy to share more data if you need.\n\nOpen to collaborate on interesting projects!  \n",

      "body": "CentML, the startup focused on compiler/runtime optimization for AI inference, was just acquired by NVIDIA. Their work centered on making single-model inference faster and cheaper , via batching, quantization (AWQ/GPTQ), kernel fusion, etc.\n\nThis feels like a strong signal: inference infra is no longer just a supporting layer. NVIDIA is clearly moving to own both the hardware and the software that controls inference efficiency.\n\nThat said, CentML tackled one piece of the puzzle , mostly within-model optimization. The messier problems : cold starts, multi-model orchestration, and efficient GPU sharing , are still wide open. We’re working on some of those challenges ourselves (e.g., InferX is focused on runtime-level orchestration and snapshotting to reduce cold start latency on shared GPUs).\n\nCurious how others see this playing out. Are we headed for a vertically integrated stack (hardware + compiler + serving), or is there still space for modular, open runtime layers?\n",

      "title": "Consumer hardware landscape for local LLMs June 2025",
      "body": "As a follow-up to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lmf42g/which_is_the_best_16gb_nvidia_gpu_with_balanced/), where OP asked for best 16GB GPU \"with balanced price and performance\". \n\nFor models where \"model size\" \\* \"user performance requirements\" in total require more bandwidth than CPU/system memory can deliver, there is as of June 2025 no cheaper way than RTX 3090 to get to 24-48-72GB of really fast memory. RTX 3090 still offers the best bang for the buck.\n\nCaveats: At least for inferencing. At this point in time. For a sizeable subset of available models \"regular\" people want to run at this point in time. With what is considered satisfying performance at this point in time. (YMMV. For me it is good enough quality, slightly faster than I can read.)\n\nAlso, LLMs have the same effect as sailboats: you always yearn for the next bigger size.\n\nRTX 3090 is not going to remain on top of that list forever. It is not obvious to me what is going to replace it in the hobbyist space in the immediate future.\n\n\n\nMy take on the common consumer/prosumer hardware currently available for running LLMs locally:\n\nRTX 3090. Only available as second-hand or (possibly not anymore?) a refurb. **Likely a better option than any non-x090-card in the RTX 4000 or RTX 5000 product lines.**\n\n**I**f you already have a 12GB 3060 or whatever, don't hold off playing with LLMs until you have better hardware! But if you plan to buy hardware for the explicit purpose of playing with LLMs, try to get your hands on a 3090. Because when you eventually want to scale up the \\*size\\* of the memory, you are very likely going to want the additional memory \\*bandwidth\\* as well. The 3090 can still be resold, the cost of a new 3060 may be challenging to recover.\n\nRTX 4090 does not offer a compelling performance uplift over 3090 for LLM inferencing, and is 2-2.5x the price as a second-hand option. If you already have one, great. Use it.\n\nRTX 5090 is approaching la-la-land in terms of price/performance for hobbyists. But it \\*has\\* more memory and better performance.\n\nRTX 6000 Blackwell is actually kind of reasonably priced per GB. But at 8-9k+ USD or whatever, it is still way out of reach for most hobbyists/consumers. Beware of power requirements and (still) some software issues/bugs.\n\nNvidia DGX Spark (Digits) is definitely interesting. But with \"only\" 128GB memory, it sort of falls in the middle. Not really enough memory for the big models, too expensive for the small models. Clustering is an option, send more money. Availability is still up in the air, I think.\n\nAMD Strix Halo is a hint at what may come with Medusa Halo (2026) and Gorgon Point (2026-2027). I do not think either of these will come close to match the RTX 3090 in memory bandwidth. But maybe we can get one with 256GB memory? (Not with Strix Halo). And with 256GB, medium sized MoE models may become practical for more of us. (Consumers) We'll see what arrives, and how much it will cost.\n\nApple Silicon kind of already offers what the AMD APUs (eventually) may deliver in terms of memory bandwidth and size, but tied to OSX and the Apple universe. And the famous Apple tax. Software support appears to be decent.\n\nIntel and AMD are already making stuff which rivals Nvidia's hegemony at the (low end of the) GPU consumer market. The software story is developing, apparently in the right direction. \n\nVery high bar for new contenders on the hardware side, I think. No matter who you are, you are likely going to need commitments from one of Samsung, SK Hynix or Micron in order to actually bring stuff to market *at volume*. And unless you can do it at volume, your stuff will be too expensive for consumers.  Qualcomm, Mediatek maybe? Or one of the memory manufacturers themselves. And then, you still need software-support.  Either for your custom accelerator/GPU in relevant libraries, or in Linux for your complete system.\n\nIt is also possible someone comes up with something insanely smart in software to substantially lower the computational and/or bandwidth cost. For example by combining system memory and GPU memory with smart offloading of caches/layers, which is already a thing. (Curious about how DGX Spark will perform in this setup.) Or maybe someone figures out how to compress current models to a third with no quality loss, thereby reducing the need for memory. For example.\n\nRegular people are still short on *affordable* systems holding at least 256GB or more of memory. Threadripper PRO does exist, but the ones with actual memory bandwidth are not affordable. And neither is 256GB of DDR5 DIMMs. \n\n\n\nSo, my somewhat opinionated perspective. Feel free to let me know what I have missed. ",

      "title": "Many small evals are better than one big eval [techniques]",
      "body": "Hi everyone! I've been building AI products for 9 years (at my own startup, then at Apple, now at a second startup) and learned a lot along the way. I’ve been talking to a bunch of folks about evals lately, and I’ve realized most people aren’t creating them because they don’t know how to get started.\n\n**TL;DR** You probably should setup your project for many small evals, and not try to create one big eval for product quality. If you can generate a new small/focused eval in under 10 mins, your team will create them when they spot issues, and your quality will get much better over time.\n\nAt a high level, here’s why this works:\n\n* The easier it is to add an eval, the more you’ll do it, and that improves quality. Small and focused evals are much easier to add than large multi-focus evals.\n* Products change over time, so big evals are almost impossible to keep up to date.\n* Small evals help you pinpoint errors, which makes them easier to fix.\n* Different team members bring unique insights (PM, Eng, QA, DS, etc). Letting them all contribute to evals leads to higher quality AI systems.\n\n# Example\n\nHere’s an example of what I mean by “many small evals”. You can see the small evals are a lot more interesting than just the final total (+4%). You can break-out product goals or issues, track them separately and see exactly what breaks and when (kinda like unit tests + CI in software). In this case looking at overall alone (+4%), would hide really critical regressions (-18% in one area).\n\n|Many Small Eval Scorecard|Comparing Models|\n|:-|:-|\n|Clarify unclear requests|93% (+9%)|\n|Refuse to discuss competitors|100% (+1%)|\n|Reject toxic requests|100% (even)|\n|Offer rebate before cancelation|72% (-18%)|\n|Follow brand styleguide|85% (-1%)|\n|Only link to official docs|99% (even)|\n|Avoid 'clickbait' titles|96% (+5%)|\n|Knowledge base retrieval recall|94% (+7%)|\n|Overall|94% (+4%)|\n\nThe cost of getting started is also much lower: you can add small evals here and there. Over time you’ll build a comprehensive eval suite.\n\n# How to get started\n\n* **Setup a good eval tool**: to be fast an easy you need 1) synthetic eval data gen, 2) intuitive UI, 3) human preferences baselining, 4) rapid side-by-side comparisons of run-methods.\n* **Teach your team to build evals**: a quick 30 mins is enough if your tool is intuitive.\n* **Create a culture of evaluation**: continually encourage folks to create evals when they spot quality issues or fix bugs.\n\nI've been building a free and open tool called \\~[Kiln](https://getkiln.ai/)\\~ which makes this process easy. It includes:\n\n* Create new evals in a few clicks: LLM-as-Judge and G-Eval\n* Synthetic data gen for eval and golden datasets\n* Baseline LLM judges to human ratings\n* Using evals to find the best way to run your AI workload (model/prompt/tunes)\n* Completely free on Github!\n\nIf you want to check out the tool or our guides:\n\n* \\~[Kiln AI on Github - over 3800 stars](https://getkiln.ai/)\\~\n* \\~[Our Evals Guide/Docs](https://docs.getkiln.ai/docs/evaluations)\\~\n* \\~[Blog post on small evals vs large evals (same ideas as above in more depth)](https://getkiln.ai/blog/you_need_many_small_evals_for_ai_products)\\~\n* \\~[Kiln AI - Overview and Docs](https://getkiln.ai/)\\~\n\nI'm happy to answer questions if anyone wants to dive deeper on specific aspects!",

      "body": "Hey r/LocalLlama! Wanted to share something interesting I've been working on that might be relevant for folks running models locally on Apple Silicon.\n\n**What I did**\n\nUsed evolutionary programming to automatically optimize Metal GPU kernels for transformer attention. Specifically targeted Qwen3-0.6B's grouped query attention (40:8 head ratio) running on Apple M-series GPUs through MLX.\n\n**Results**\n\nTested across 20 different inference scenarios against MLX's `scaled_dot_product_attention` baseline:\n\n* **Average decode speed improvement: +12.5%** (σ = 38.3%)\n* **Peak improvement: +106%** on repetitive pattern generation\n* **Best category: +24.8%** average on general tasks\n* **Memory usage: -0.99%** (slight reduction)\n\n**The honest picture:** It's workload dependent. Some scenarios saw big gains (+46.6% on dialogue, +73.9% on extreme-length generation), but others regressed (-16.5% on code generation). Success rate was 7/20 benchmarks with \u0026gt;25% improvements.\n\n**How it works**\n\nThe system automatically evolves the Metal kernel source code using LLMs while preserving the MLX integration. No human GPU programming expertise was provided - it discovered optimizations like:\n\n1. **Perfect SIMD vectorization**: Found that `vec\u0026lt;T, 8\u0026gt;` operations match Apple Silicon's capabilities for 128-dim attention heads\n2. **Two-pass online softmax**: Fused softmax normalization with value accumulation, reducing memory bandwidth\n3. **GQA-specific memory patterns**: Optimized for the 40:8 head structure with coalesced access patterns\n\n# Why this might matter for local inference\n\n* Shows automated optimization can compete with expert-engineered kernels\n* Demonstrates potential for hardware-specific optimizations without manual tuning\n* Could be applied to other transformer components or different model architectures\n* All open source - you can reproduce and extend this work\n\n**Try it yourself**\n\nThe code and all benchmarks are available in the [OpenEvolve repo](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve). The MLX kernel optimization example is at `examples/mlx_metal_kernel_opt/`.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Apple Silicon Mac\n* MLX framework\n* Qwen3-0.6B model\n\n# Limitations\n\n* Currently specific to Apple Silicon and this exact model configuration\n* Performance improvements are highly workload-dependent\n* Takes \\~25 evolutionary generations to converge (few hours on M3)\n* No guarantees it'll work better for your specific use case\n\n**Technical write-up**\n\nFull details with code diffs and benchmark methodology: [https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/openevolve-gpu-kernel-discovery](https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/openevolve-gpu-kernel-discovery)\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from folks who've done MLX optimization work, or if anyone wants to try this on different models/configurations. The evolutionary approach seems promising but definitely has room for improvement.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with automated kernel optimization for local inference?",
