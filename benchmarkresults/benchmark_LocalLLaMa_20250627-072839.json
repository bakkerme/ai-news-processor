Without pro is 48gb. I really want to know how many FOPS it is. Or the t/s for a deepseek 70B or largest model it can fit. \nComment: Get some silly concurrency going on qwen 3 32b awq and run the aider benchmark. \nComment: Flux to generate pics of your dream Audi. Find out your use case and try some models that fit. I was first impressed by GLM 4 in one shot coding, but it fails to use other tools. Mistral small is my daily driver currently. It's even fluent in most languages. \nComment: That’s some expensive computer hardware. Congratulations. \nComment: That’s our serial number now \nComment: Your power connectors. \nComment: i cant imagine spending that much money on a gpu with that power connector \nComment: Houston we have lift off  https://preview.redd.it/v3z4prno2wye1.png?width=780\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=6a6156b3fc0818b93b0459a14c86a0e0dd1d70d7 \nComment: https://preview.redd.it/5bnvabxayvye1.jpeg?width=3000\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=9516acddbdda888267887c823c70c25db1ba8c6e New card installed! \nComment: Is it better then a h100 performance wise? i know the vram is slightly bigger. \nComment: Quake I \nComment: Everything. In all seriousness, I would reaaally like to see the benchmarks on that thing \nComment: Old school runescape \nComment: Cancer research. \nComment: OT, but run 3Dmark and confirm if it really is faster in games than the 5090 (for once in the history of workstation cards). \nComment: dude you are so lucky congrats!! run every qwen 3 model and make videos! i hear you stream, how about a live stream using llama.cpp and testing out models, or lm studio. this card is so awesome 😍 \nComment: Something like Gemma 3 27B/Mistral small-3/Qwen 3 32B with maximum context size? \nComment: Qwen3 and don’t look back \nComment: Qwen 30B A3B q8 has something around 30 GB file size.

Etc… \nComment: GTA V \nComment: Grounding strap. \nComment: Crysis \nComment: Plex Media Server. But make sure to hack your drivers. \nComment: Mate, share some benchmarks!  I’m about ready to pull the trigger on one too, but the price gouging here is insane. They’re still selling Ampere A6000s for 6–7K AUD, and the Ada version is going for as much as 12K.  Instead of dropping prices on the older cards, they’re just marking up the new Blackwell ones way above MSRP. The server variant of this exact card is already sitting at 17K AUD (~11K USD)—absolute piss take tbh. \nComment: Image and clip generation \nComment: I think I'll stream getting some LLMs and comfyui up tomorrow and the next few days. give a follow if you want to be notified https://twitch.tv/faustcircuits \nComment: Get that unsloth 235B Qwen3 model at Q2K_XL. It should fit. Q2 is the most efficient size when it comes to benchmark score to size ratio according to unsloths documentation. It should be fast AF too since only 22B active parameters.  \nComment: Nice! Still waiting for mine. Can you let me know if you are able to disable ECC or not? \nComment: what Audi is that? S4? \nComment: Nice. Run stuff and share stats! Would be cool to see. \nComment: https://preview.redd.it/ems9w2z6yvye1.jpeg?width=3000\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=76b13f186be7cb783727c000bda533c92c1e8c56 here is the old card lol \n",

Vibe coding is a bit ill-defined but what I see is a niche where people like product managers can use AI to build tiny tools that would be hard to get into a product team's priority list. In particular what I saw was using Zapier which is a user-friendly automation tool that lets you run snippets of Python or js inside workflows and now lets you generate them with AI. Great way to build little utilities without a developer but also very narrow, low stakes applications that aren't critical path. This job req wants familiarity with vector DBs and containers which means they want an actual experienced software engineer. Someone who can use a coding assistant but probably doesn't need one. That's not vibe coding. \nComment: Vibe coding 2025 is same as slapping an untested, ill designed, 700-lines-a-function Python script on anything and calling it a day in the 2015s Edit: You scrolled down on some requirements tho https://www.visa.ca/fr_ca/jobs/REF061638W \u0026gt; Strong proficiency with Python, FastAPI and PostgreSQL for backend development. \nComment: These days, stupid HRs are stuffing the job requirements sections with as many tech buzzwords as possible, regardless of whether these buzzwords actually reflect the technologies used in the company. I feel like \"vibe coding\" may be one of those buzzwords. \nComment: now exactly nobody will know why credit card applications failed \nComment: Maybe we should all \"vibe-pay\" our Visa card bills. \nComment: Click click, sold all visa stocks instantly \nComment: I for one am happy my CC transactions are handled by vibed up systems. \nComment: they are starting up an ml intership for students next summer in poland too \nComment: I don't even know what to think. My general reaction of most job posts is to assume the companily already has someone they're gonna hire, and the position is only being posted as a formality and to make it appear that the company has fair hiring practices (even though requirements weed out people that are perfectly capable of being trained). \nComment: I know some folks working with such teams. They have ambitions to build vibe coding tools (like cursor) but without the dependency on letting data go out of the org (from a financial reg pov). Visa’s CTO is one of the highest paid CTOs in the US, and they are building agents replicating (gamma.ai, OpenAI deep research, Agentic Commerce) to start with. \nComment: They are even Vibe-using Caps. That's so Vibe. It gives me Bad Vibes. \nComment: That job posting is clear as mud. Title is an obvious mismatch for the skillset. \nComment: well I'm glad none of my credit cards are visa...  \nComment: what could possibly go wrong? \nComment: If they are listing the tech stacks that should be enough. \nComment: At least they're not requiring minimum 15 years of experience \nComment: Lmao \nComment: AI generated job posting ? :p \nComment: Vibe coding doesn't work. It takes me 10-20 prompts to generate anything useful with gemini 2.5.  Sometimes 30+ prompts even with explicit instructions. \nComment: And I thought it was a big deal 15 years ago when I talked NASA into letting me put “auto-generated” guidance and control code into a satellite. That particular NASA center had never done such a thing, and I had to pop their cherry on it (as a contractor). Partly because a colleague of mine was doing the same thing on a bigger project, and he really wanted to be able to say his project wasn’t the first. The “auto-generation” step is just compiling MatLab down into C code, and from there is just standard C compilation on the target environment. But the MatLab becomes the source code, in this case. And you have to version-control the auto-generation configuration as well.  Honestly, with all the other shit we had to deal with on that program, just telling an AI to “write some code that might look like spacecraft guidance and control software, no particular requirements because we’re don’t have the money to actually test the hardware before launch, and most of it is going to fail anyway” would have been such a stress-saver. That’s a good vibe. \nComment: As someone already posted, these are not the full requirements, but another thing also:  Vibe-coding is expensive. Requests can quickly become $1-2 a piece. Over the course of a month, you could easily rack up $500+ if you're using it liberally. Now consider that you're already paying a regular salary, put this on top, and it becomes kind of unsustainable.  The money has to come from somewhere, and it's most probably the base pay. \nComment: I don't know much about developers as vibe coders. But, a lot of project managers \u0026amp; UI UX folks and product managers are starting to learn these tools (lovable, cursor, etc.,) and will roll out the basic screens for evaluation.  Also, this will start getting back to actual developers on justifying their timelines, complexity justifications, etc., This is mostly as nobody gives a fuck about code maintainability, reusability, tech debt, security, etc,.  Other side to this coin is 90% of code written by \u0026lt;5 years experienced devs are not following these standards anyways 🤷‍♂️ 90% of products from start-ups and other IT companies never see the light anyways 🤦‍♂️🤣 \n",

You can also see benchmarks for a few other models here. If you want to see benchmarks for any others, feel free to request them and we’ll try to publish ASAP! Lastly, you can run your own benchmarks on our devices for free (limited to some degree to avoid our devices melting!). This free/public version is a bit of a frankenstein fork of our enterprise product, so any benchmarks you run would be private to your account. But if there's interest, we can add a way for you to also publish them so that the public benchmarks aren’t bottlenecked by us.  It’s still very early days for us with this, so please let us know what would make it better/cooler for the community: https://edgemeter.runlocal.ai/public/pipelines To more on-device AI in production! 💪 https://i.redd.it/aev5rgjazsye1.gif    submitted by    /u/intofuture   [link]   [comments] \nComment: Iphone 16's Metal performance is pretty impressive for 1.6b-q8. But I do wonder why q8's performance is faster than q4 in that particular setup. \nComment: It’s interesting to see that performance in m4 is pretty similar in both cpu and gpu \nComment: There's one edge factor you missed - on Metal backend when you get OOM you get completely wrong results. For example on Qwen3 8B Q4 your results are like this: - MacBook Pro M1, 8GB = 99232.83tok/s prefill, 2133.70tok/s generation - MacBook Pro M3, 8GB = 90508.66tok/s prefill, 2507.50tok/s generation If you wouldn't get OOM the correct results for that model should be around ~100-150tok/s prefill and ~10tok/s generation. Additionally, all results for RAM usage on Apple silicon \u0026amp; Metal are not correct. In terms of your UX/UI there's tons of stuff that should be improved. but to not make this into very long post I'll write about biggest problems that can be fixed rather easily. First, add option to hide columns, there's too much redundant information that should be possible to hide with just couple of clicks. Second, decide on some naming scheme for components and stick with it. https://preview.redd.it/8idjxghteuye1.png?width=91\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=12d1d9317495b745768b9dd012288be1eb804964 I would suggest to get rid of 'Apple'/'Bionic' names altogether - it just adds to complexity and cognitive load to a table that is already very dense. There is no non-Apple M1 in Macbooks or non-Bionic A12 in iPad, so you don't need to clarify that much in a first place and additionally this page is aimed at technical people. Exact same problem with Samsung/Google vs Snapdragon. Third, if both CPU and Metal failed don't create two entries. Table is 2x longer than it should be with results that are non-comparable to anything. Just combine it into one entry. \nComment: How to run on metal on iphone 16 pro? I have pocketpal app and how to switch from cpu to metal? \nComment: if i'm reading this correctly the load time on cpu is better than gpu/metal for macbook pro but the gpu/metal is less memory intensive? also metal perf on iphone 16 is pretty impressive. \nComment: How do I run this on Android? Rn it just crashes \nComment: Why is Q8 faster than Q4??? \nComment: For laptops, is vulkan using the igpu ? \nComment: according to this data on iphone 16 you have 24 t/s on Q8 and 22 t/s on Q4 why so tiny models? \nComment: The iPhone 16e is listed to have the A18 Pro SoC but it actually has the A18.  https://preview.redd.it/h1dx2hgphvye1.png?width=623\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=c2f8794bf27c6a9042b81040ebefa09873eae989 \n",

They currently maintain ~50 devices and plan to expand this to 100+. The primary motivation behind this project is to provide crucial performance metrics that determine the feasibility of deploying AI models in apps without causing issues like crashes or high resource consumption. Currently, they support model formats such as Core ML, ONNX, and TFLite; GGUF support is still under development.\n\nThe team has started publishing Qwen3 benchmarks, with plans to extend this to other models based on community requests. They acknowledge the complexity in interpreting the data due to numerous variables like devices and backends, promising improvements in this area. Users can also run their own benchmarks for free on RunLocal's devices, although these results remain private to the user's account at present.\n\nThe project is still in its early stages, and RunLocal encourages community feedback to enhance the tool's utility and usability: https://edgemeter.runlocal.ai/public/pipelines.",
        "commentSummary": "Community members have expressed interest and provided valuable feedback on the benchmarks. Some users questioned the discrepancies in performance between Q8 and Q4 on specific devices, while others pointed out issues with Metal backend performance on Apple silicon, leading to incorrect results upon Out-of-Memory (OOM) situations. There are also suggestions for improving the user interface, such as hiding redundant columns, standardizing naming schemes, and streamlining the presentation of results.\n\nUsers have inquired about running benchmarks on Android devices and switching from CPU to Metal on iPhone 16 Pro. Some users noted interesting observations, like better load times but higher memory efficiency with GPU/Metal on MacBook Pros.

IMO on llama.cpp you shouldn’t push it past Q8_0. Q4_0 cache quant tanks quality in any model and especially models that heavily leverage GQA.  \nComment: I have one rule: I always test ALL new models without flash attention and with full 16bit KV cache. \nComment: Which KV quantization are you using? Don't have time to run this test right now, but I usually use -ctk q8_0 -ctv q5_1 (requires -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=on) \nComment: Ive only tried KV quantization once and saw that any amount of it makes models super dumb. Not sure why anybody uses it tbh \nComment: Which quantization did you use initially? \nComment: Interested here since I'm running a q6 \nComment: Use these parameters: Thinking Mode Settings: Temperature = 0.6 Min_P = 0.0 Top_P = 0.95 TopK = 20 Non-Thinking Mode Settings: Temperature = 0.7  Min_P = 0.0 Top_P = 0.8 TopK = 20 \nComment: Could you please tell us how to disable KV cache quantisation? I'd also like to check the difference. What is the difference in the amount of memory used with KV running at fp16 in comparison with regular q4? \nComment: I’m confused. Isn’t K_M KV quantization? And yet you said Qwen 30b solved the rest with Q4 K_M? \nComment: Of course  Cache should always be fp16 even Q8 has degradation. Only flash attention is ok...ish ( as is fp16 ) \n",

References  ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/370     submitted by    /u/VoidAlchemy   [link]   [comments] \nComment: I'm currently running ik_llama.cpp with Qwen3-235B-A22 on a Xeon E5-2680v4, that's a 10 year old CPU with 128GB ddr4 memory, and a single RTX3090. I'm getting 7 tok/s generation, very usable if you don't use reasoning. BTW the server is multi-GPU but ik_llama.cpp just crash trying to use multiple-gpus, but I don't think it would improve speed a lot, as the CPU is always the bottleneck. \nComment: Could you explain how to read your pictures? I see orange plot below red plot, so ik_llama.cpp is slower than llama.cpp? \nComment: Can you post some of the commands you use for the benchmarks? I want to tinker to see what is best for my use case \nComment: Oh, just updated. My rig is busy for running deepseek \u0026amp; ik_llama (1 week jobs). I will update after that :) \nComment: Maybe GGUF will now give same speed as MLX on Mac devices \nComment: I have a 3090. Doesn't this say it's slower, not faster? \nComment: https://preview.redd.it/0zroyhg1qsye1.png?width=3404\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=b3e55128b1aac3f6d2ddfbd22597b9cd6d7dd02c In my limited testing you probably want to go with ik_llama.cpp for fully offloaded non-MoE models like the recent GLM-4 which is crazy efficient on kv-cache VRAM usage due to its GQA design. \nComment: I just pulled and rebuilt and I'm now actually going about 15 tps slower. My previous build was from about a week ago, and I was getting an eval time of about 54 tps. Now I'm only getting 39 tokens per second, so pretty significant drop. I just downloaded the latest unsloth model I'm running on 2 3090s, using this command: ``` .\\bin\\Release\\llama-server.exe -m C:\\shared-drive\\llm_models\\unsloth-2-Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-Q8_0.gguf --host 0.0.0.0 --ctx-size 50000 --n-predict 10000 --jinja --tensor-split 14,14 --top_k 20 --min_p 0.0 --top_p 0.8 --flash-attn --n-gpu-layers 9999 --threads 24 ``` Prompt: \"tell me a 2 paragraph story\" \nComment: How close is llamacpp to vLLM and exllama now? \nComment: Seems like it is related to CUDA only, so I guess only for people with Nvidia cards and not folks on Apple Silicon and others. \n",

But I wonder if the Qwen3 dense models with reasoning turned off also outperforms Qwen2.5. Essentially what I am wondering is if the improvements mostly come from the reasoning.    submitted by    /u/No-Bicycle-132   [link]   [comments]\nComment: On aider polyglot there was a huge boost from 16.4% of qwen 2.5 coder whole to qwen 3 32B (no thinking) achieving 45.8% being ahead of gpt 4.5. \nComment: Don't stop at wondering. Why don't you test it and share your result with us? \nComment: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1keh542/qwen3_on_dubesor_benchmark/ \nComment: Depends on the task. For code autocomplete Qwen/Qwen3-14B-AWQ nothink is awful. I like Qwen2.5-coder:14b. Additionally: some quants might be broken. \nComment: The 2.5 coders are better at complex one shots. 3.0 seems to generalize better and retains logic over a multiturn edit. My work involves updating lots of legacy Fortran and cobol that is written with very specific formatting and comment practices. 3.0 is the first open model that can run reasonably at 48gb vram that can reliably port my code. Also I think, for coding one shot diffs, reasoning turned off produces better results. \nComment: I have compared them far too little to be able to draw a serious conclusion, but from the very few comparisons I have made in coding, Qwen3 (no thinking) outputs better code, more accordingly to the prompt, than Qwen2.5. \nComment: The short answer is it entirely depends on your use case. In my limited testing, their overall performance was pretty close, with Qwen 3 probably being better overall.  I know the benchmarks say otherwise, but when translating Japanese to English, I found Qwen 2.5 to sound more natural.  However, when summarizing short stories, Qwen 2.5 dissected the story like a technical manual, whereas Qwen 3 wrote (or tried to write) in the tone of the original story.  Qwen 3 seems to lose less when quantized than Qwen 2.5. I was shocked at how well Qwen 3 32b functioned even down to IQ2 (except for factual retrieval which as usual takes a big hit). Coding, logical puzzles, and problem-solving seemed like a toss up. They both did it with more or less the same success; although, enabling reason will likely give Qwen 3 the edge. \nComment: Yes from what I have seen for apples to apples. But the 2.5 coding models will probably still hold tier own vs regular 3 models with thinking off. \nComment: They do. Qwen3 8b outperforms 7b 2.5; at least because of that extra 1b. \n",

        "summary": "A Reddit user initiated a discussion on comparing Qwen3 with and without reasoning against Qwen2.5. The user noted that Qwen3 with reasoning outperforms Qwen2.5, but they are curious about the performance of Qwen3's dense models when reasoning is disabled. The conversation sparked various responses from users sharing their experiences and findings. One user reported a significant boost in polyglot translation using Qwen3 (no thinking) compared to Qwen2.5 on the Dubesor benchmark. Another user mentioned that, in their limited testing, Qwen3 performed slightly better overall than Qwen2.5, though Qwen 2.5 sounded more natural when translating Japanese to English. A third user shared their experience with coding tasks, finding that Qwen3 (no thinking) produced better code adhering to the prompt compared to Qwen2.5. The users also pointed out task-specific performance variations, such as Qwen 3's superior generalization and logic retention in multiturn editing for legacy Fortran and COBOL code. In summary, while Qwen3 with reasoning shows clear improvements over Qwen2.5, the community is divided on whether disabling reasoning in Qwen3 results in better performance across different tasks.",
        "commentSummary": "The Reddit thread generated a diverse range of opinions and experiences from users comparing Qwen3 with and without reasoning to Qwen2.5. Some users reported improved performance with Qwen3 (no thinking) in specific tasks like polyglot translation and coding, while others noted that Qwen 2.5 still holds its own in certain areas such as complex one-shot tasks and natural-sounding translations. The consensus seems to be that the optimal model depends on the particular use case. Users also highlighted task-specific performance variations, with Qwen3 generally showing better generalization and logic retention for multiturn code editing of legacy systems like Fortran and COBOL. Some users suggested conducting more thorough tests to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of reasoning on overall performance.",
