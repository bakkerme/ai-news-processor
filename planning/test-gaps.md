# AI News Processor Test Gap Analysis

## Overview

This document identifies areas of the codebase that currently lack test coverage and provides recommendations for implementing tests to improve code quality and reliability.

## Current Test Coverage

The following modules have some existing test files:

- `internal/rss`: Has test files (`internal_funcs_test.go`, `image_extraction_test.go`)
- `internal/openai`: Has test file (`openai_test.go`)
- `internal/qualityfilter`: Has test file (`qualityfilter_test.go`)
- `internal/contentextractor`: Has test file (`extractor_test.go`)

## Modules Lacking Tests

The following modules lack any test files:

- `internal/llm`: Core LLM interaction components without tests
  - `processor.go` (13KB, 406 lines)
  - `llm.go`
  - `summary.go`
  
- `internal/fetcher`: No test files

- `internal/email`: No test files

- `internal/persona`: No test files

- `internal/prompts`: No test files

- `internal/models`: No test files

- `internal/processed`: No test files

- `internal/urlextraction`: No test files

- `internal/specification`: No test files

- `internal/customerrors`: No test files

- `internal/http`: No test files

## Test Priority Matrix

| Module | Complexity | Impact | Priority |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| llm    | High       | High   | 1        |
| fetcher| Medium     | High   | 2        |
| email  | Medium     | High   | 2        |
| persona| Medium     | Medium | 3        |
| prompts| Low        | High   | 3        |
| urlextraction | Medium | Medium | 4     |
| http   | Medium     | Medium | 4        |
| specification | Low  | Medium | 5       |
| customerrors | Low   | Low    | 6       |

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **LLM Module**
   - Unit tests for `processor.go` focusing on entry processing logic
   - Mock integration tests for LLM interactions
   - Tests for summary generation functionality

2. **Fetcher Module**
   - Tests for reliable fetching of content
   - Error handling tests
   - Mock tests for external dependencies

3. **Email Module**
   - Template rendering tests
   - Email sending functionality tests with mocks
   - Error handling tests

### Medium Priority

4. **Persona Module**
   - Tests for persona loading and selection
   - Configuration validation tests

5. **Prompts Module**
   - Tests for prompt composition
   - Tests for template rendering

6. **URL Extraction Module**
   - Tests for URL extraction from different content types
   - Edge case handling

### Lower Priority

7. **Models Module**
   - Structure validation tests
   - Serialization/deserialization tests

8. **HTTP Module**
   - Request/response handling tests
   - Retry mechanism tests

9. **Specification Module**
   - Configuration loading tests
   - Validation tests

## Integration Testing Gaps

The codebase lacks end-to-end integration tests that would verify the complete workflow:

1. RSS feed fetching → content extraction → LLM processing → email generation

Consider implementing integration tests with mocked external dependencies.

## Test Infrastructure Recommendations

1. Create a common test utilities package
2. Implement standard mocks for external dependencies
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
4. Implement test coverage reporting

## Conclusion

Approximately 60% of the codebase lacks proper test coverage. The highest priority should be adding tests to the LLM module, as it contains the core business logic of the application. Following that, fetcher and email modules should be prioritized due to their impact on the application's reliability.
